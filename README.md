During my 2.5 years of being a software developer, I worked on modules, functions, parts of a industry-level softwares. But never built anything in its entirety.

_Not anymore_

I have a ton of ideas and hand-held devices/mobiles are the future. With the learning and experiences I share here, I aim to move to mobile development ðŸŽˆ

There are two folders : 

- Apps 

> The Apps folder will contain the root folder of the projects/apps I develop during the course of my learning.

- Practice

> This folder will contain random stuff I may try out. I also try out code samples from places like StackOverFlow and code for that resides here.

Here is the list of apps/programs I worked/currently working on. The status is shown too, which indicates whether it is completed or is still in progress.

This is the first app I built using Flutter. It has a few questions and based on the choices, the user is given a score (individual score to question is not shown) and then it tells you whether you are the man or not!

> Taking my Flutter skills, I attempt to create an expense tracker which is (hopefully) a teeny-tiny bit fancier than the previous app.
